A user-friendly design and dependable data management were my top priorities when developing my React Native app for a clothes business. To showcase the products in an aesthetically pleasing and effective manner, I decided to use a FlatList with two columns in a grid style. A touchable add item button makes it simple for customers to add and remove products from each card that is presented.

React's useState and useEffect hooks were utilized for state management. For loading and saving data, the useEffect hook is crucial, while the useState hook maintains the list of objects. The shopping list can be stored and retrieved by the app across sessions thanks to AsyncStorage, which I created to provide data durability.

This setup ensures that users have a seamless experience with their data consistently saved, making the app both functional and reliable.
